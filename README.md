# ðŸŽ§ YouTube Playlist Audio Ripper

This is a Bash script to download **entire YouTube playlists** as high-quality audio files (MP3 or any supported format) using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It avoids Googleâ€™s rate-limiting and bot detection by downloading each video separately with randomized delays.

## âœ¨ Features

- Extracts all video links from a playlist
- Converts video to audio (MP3 or user-specified format)
- Embeds thumbnails automatically (if `ffmpeg` is installed)
- Sleeps random intervals (15â€“60 seconds) between downloads to avoid throttling
- Stores video URLs in a temporary file for transparency and troubleshooting
- Optional cleanup of the temporary URL list

- `ffmpeg` (for audio conversion + thumbnail embedding)
- Bash-compatible shell (Linux, macOS, WSL)

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg
